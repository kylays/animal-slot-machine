Beavers are large, semiaquatic rodents native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Beavers build dams and lodges using tree branches, vegetation, rocks and mud; they chew down trees for building material. Dams impound water and lodges serve as shelters. Adult males and females live in monogamous pairs with their offspring.
